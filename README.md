## PR Auto Version Bump
GitHub action that automatically bumps the version in `package.json` of your pull request based on PR labels by comparing the versinon of your PR to the version of the main branch.
Currently. The next version will be automatically committed and pushed to your Pull Request.
This action is useful when the version **can not** be automatically bumped after a merge because the main branch is protected.

## Workflow
* The action will be triggered based on your PR's labels.
  * Currently, only these labels are supported: `major`, `minor`, `patch`.
  * if current version is `1.0.0` and the label is `minor` then version will be bumped to `1.1.0`
* The action will fail if:
  * There are no labels provided
  * More than one label were applied. i.e. patch, major
* When labels change, the action will automatically trigger.

## Options
### Inputs
* **GITHUB_TOKEN** (required): GitHub access token
### Outputs
* **NEXT_VERSION**: The newly bumped version

## Usage
```yaml
- name: Pull Request Semver Action
  uses: fadi-quader-mox/pr-version-bump@v1.0.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

It's recommend to use this action with [`styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.10.0`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cancel-workflow-action) to cancel previous running actions in order to avoid confliciting actions
